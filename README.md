# Hide Github PR Review Comments
I made a chrome extension that hides github pr comments on your side alone. This is useful especially when reviewers insist on marking comments as resolved themselves. This happens when a reviewer wants to keep the comments unresolved for their future reference. I have had quite a bit of experience with such reviewers on github. I do get their point considering they want to see what they commented and what changes were made after that. 

This extension hides github pr review comments but only on your side so that you can keep track of which all comments have been completed without marking it as resolved. The state persists on refresh and only resets on switching the extension off.

Just clone the repo and load unpacked extension from the folder :)

1. As soon as you enable the extension and switch it on, it shows the hide button

2. Upon clicking the hide button, the comment disappears but it stays unresolved for the reviewer.
