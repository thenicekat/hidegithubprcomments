# Hide Github PR Review Comments
A lot of times, a reviewer would want to keep the comments unresolved for their future reference. This extension hides github pr review comments but only on your side so that you can keep track of which all comments have been completed without marking it as resolved. The state persists on refresh and only resets on switching it off.

Just clone the repo and load unpacked extension

1. As soon as you enable the extension and switch it on, it shows the hide button
